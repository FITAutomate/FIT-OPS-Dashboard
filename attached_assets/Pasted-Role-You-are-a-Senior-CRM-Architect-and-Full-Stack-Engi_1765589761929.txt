Role: You are a Senior CRM Architect and Full-Stack Engineer. Your primary directive is to build the most modular, maintainable, and visually branded application possible.
Goal: Create the initial version of the "FIT CRM" web application. Focus on establishing the architecture, the UI, and the separated API service layer.
Tech Stack & Architecture:
•	Frontend: React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS (Strict adherence to the FIT Design System).
•	Backend: Python (Flask/Gunicorn) for the API layer.
•	Modularity: All external API logic must be entirely contained within dedicated Service files. The core application logic must only call high-level functions from these services (e.g., hubspot_service.get_all_deals()).
🔒 Secrets & Configuration:
1.	Environment Variables: Reference all sensitive keys and dynamic IDs (Base IDs, Pipeline IDs, Tokens) from environment variables (Replit Secrets).
2.	Central Configuration: Create a dedicated config.py file to define:
o	All Airtable table names.
o	All HubSpot pipeline stages.
o	A clear FIELD_MAPPING dictionary for synchronizing data between the two platforms.
🎨 FIT Design System (Strict Implementation Required):
•	Color Palette:
o	fit-blue: #007CE8 (Primary)
o	fit-green: #1CD000 (Accent, Success)
o	fit-dark: #00006C (Sidebar Background)
o	fit-light: #DBE2E3 (Card Background)
•	Typography: Headings: Montserrat | Body: Open Sans (Import Google Fonts).
•	Layout: Fixed Dark Gradient sidebar, White main content area. Rounded buttons (pill shape, gradient fill).
•	Logo: Create an /assets folder with a logo.png placeholder and place it at the top of the sidebar.
•	You can use https://forwarditthinking.com for reference.
⚙️ Core Service Requirements (The Modular Foundation):
1.	Airtable Service: Create airtable_service.py. It should contain functions for getting and updating records from the tables defined in the schema below.
2.	HubSpot Service: Create hubspot_service.py. It should contain functions for getting and updating Deals and their properties.
3.	Outlook 365 Service (Placeholder): Create outlook_service.py. Do NOT implement the full OAuth flow. Instead, implement placeholder functions like outlook_service.get_calendar_events() and outlook_service.create_event(). The function bodies should simply return mock data and contain comments detailing the required Microsoft Graph API endpoints, scopes, and the authentication difficulty (multi-step OAuth 2.0). This separates the code and signals a future feature.
✨ Frontend Components & Dashboard:
•	Create the main layout (Sidebar, Topbar).
•	Build the Dashboard page using mock data returned from the service files (until we connect the APIs).
•	The Dashboard must feature an "Upcoming Events" widget powered by the mock data from outlook_service.py.
Data Context (Use for Mocking in Phase 1):

Synthesize this information into a brief summary that gives a clear snapshot of the deal's status, its potential value, and what needs to happen next. Focus on clarity and relevance for quick decision-making.\n\nOutput format:\nWrite a 2-4 sentence summary in plain text, without headings, bullet points, or extra formatting. Clearly mention the deal name, company, service type, current stage, expected value (as a currency, e.g. $10,000), probability percentage, and next step. If notes are present, briefly mention any key context or risks. Do not include any additional commentary or explanation. If any critical information is missing, output \"Insufficient data to summarize this deal.\"\nExample: \"Deal 'Automation Upgrade' with Acme Corp is at the Proposal Sent stage for a Smart Automations service, valued at $15,000 with a 60% probability.

Based on these factors, determine whether the deal is strong, at risk, stalled, or high potential. Justify your assessment with 1-2 sentences of reasoning, referencing relevant data points such as stage progression, time in pipeline, clarity of next steps, and any risks or concerns noted. Be objective and actionable.\n\nOutput format:\nOutput a short status (\"Strong\", \"At Risk\", \"Stalled\", or \"High Potential\") followed by a colon and a brief justification in plain text. Do not use headings, bullet points, or extra formatting. Do not include any additional commentary. If insufficient information is available to make an assessment, output \"Insufficient data to assess deal health.\"\nExample: \"At Risk: Deal has been in Negotiation for 45 days with no clear next step and low probability.\"\n\nContext and Data:\nStage: ",
